# How I Secured AJ Lab with Azure’s Advanced Hunting

During routine maintenance of my personal AJ Lab, a custom-built environment for testing real-world IT scenarios, I launched a project to scrutinise the security of my shared services cluster, encompassing critical components like DNS, DHCP, and beyond. Using Microsoft Defender’s Advanced Hunting within Azure, I designed a KQL query to analyse IdentityLogonEvents, uncovering potential misconfigurations in my virtual machines and identifying simulated brute-force login attempts from external IPs. Leveraging Azure’s scalable analytics, I aligned this effort with NIST’s ‘Identify’ and ‘Detect’ principles, gaining precise insights into my lab’s resilience. The approach also mapped to ISO27001’s risk management controls, ISO27002’s monitoring standards, PCI DSS’s logging requirements, and GDPR’s data protection framework—all enhanced by Defender’s capabilities and Azure’s robust cloud infrastructure. This initiative fortified my lab and honed my ability to architect secure, compliant solutions. 

I’ve detailed the process in a video; see below for a closer look.
